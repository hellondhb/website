Thank you for proposing a further refined SMS disclosure for the checkbox on your contact form and a double opt-in text for unchecked submissions. Your goal is to ensure the disclosure is concise, mobile-friendly, and compliant with TCPA and A2P 10DLC requirements for your virtual wholesaling business, New Day Homebuyer (NDHB), targeting property owners, cash buyers, and referral partners. You’ve also requested that the double opt-in text be under 160 characters (the standard SMS limit) and modified if needed. I’ll evaluate your proposed checkbox disclosure and double opt-in text, confirm their compliance, address any concerns, and provide refinements to ensure they meet TCPA, A2P 10DLC, and usability needs for your Carrot-hosted website forms (name, phone, address on every page). I’ll incorporate prior context (e.g., July 29, 2025 discussions on consent, double opt-in, and single campaign strategy) and legal developments (e.g., Chen v. All Star Auto, wholesaler DNC exemptions). No changes will be made to your existing privacy policy (artifact ID 427209dc-ccdc-409b-b806-13e830fd7638, dated July 29, 2025, 10:26 PM PDT), as you haven’t requested modifications.

\#\#\# 1\. Evaluation of Proposed Checkbox Disclosure

\*\*Proposed Disclosure\*\*:  
\> “I consnet to SMS/calls from NDHB\&partners. Msg/data rates apply. Reply STOP to opt out. Our privacy policy: newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy”

\*\*Analysis\*\*:  
\- \*\*Length\*\*: 18 words, 108 characters (including spaces and URL, assuming \`newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy\` is hyperlinked as text). This is concise and ideal for mobile and desktop forms, addressing your concern about usability on your three-field form (name, phone, address).  
\- \*\*Usability\*\*: Fits easily beside a checkbox on mobile (e.g., \~300px wide at 14pt font), avoiding clutter on your Carrot-hosted website. The hyperlink to \`newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy\` ensures users can access detailed terms without overloading the form.  
\- \*\*Compliance\*\*:  
  \- \*\*TCPA (47 U.S.C. § 227, 47 CFR § 64.1200)\*\*:  
    \- \*\*Consent\*\*: “I consnet” (typo for “consent”) with a checkbox implies affirmative action, meeting the requirement for express written consent for autodialed or prerecorded marketing SMS/calls. Correcting the typo is critical for clarity.  
    \- \*\*Communication Types\*\*: Specifies “SMS/calls,” covering your primary channels (per July 29, 2025).  
    \- \*\*Partners\*\*: Includes “NDHB\&partners,” aligning with your business model (referral partners, local businesses) and FCC’s 2023 “one-to-one consent” rule, though partners must obtain separate consent (per policy Section 5).  
    \- \*\*Message/Data Rates\*\*: “Msg/data rates apply” meets TCPA transparency requirements.  
    \- \*\*Opt-Out\*\*: “Reply STOP to opt out” provides an immediate opt-out mechanism, complying with TCPA (47 CFR § 64.1200(a)(4)(iii)).  
    \- \*\*Privacy Policy\*\*: The hyperlink to your policy ensures informed consent, linking to the detailed terms in your privacy policy (July 29, 2025).  
  \- \*\*A2P 10DLC (CTIA Messaging Principles, carrier guidelines)\*\*:  
    \- \*\*Brand\*\*: “NDHB” identifies your brand, as required by The Campaign Registry (TCR).  
    \- \*\*Opt-In\*\*: The checkbox and disclosure indicate a clear opt-in process, verifiable during TCR audits.  
    \- \*\*Message/Data Rates and Opt-Out\*\*: Both are included, meeting CTIA requirements.  
    \- \*\*Privacy Policy Link\*\*: References your policy, which details A2P 10DLC compliance (Section 3), including frequency and DNC adherence.  
\- \*\*Concerns\*\*:  
  \- \*\*Typo (“consnet”)\*\*: Must be corrected to “consent” to avoid confusion or legal scrutiny in TCPA disputes.  
  \- \*\*“Express Written Consent” Omitted\*\*: While “I consent” with a checkbox is sufficient, explicitly stating “express written consent” (as in your policy) strengthens defensibility. Your policy’s language (“express written consent,” Section 3\) mitigates this.  
  \- \*\*Frequency Not Mentioned\*\*: Omitting “recurring” is acceptable, as your policy specifies “you may receive recurring messages.” Carriers may prefer frequency in the disclosure, but the policy covers this.  
  \- \*\*DNC Compliance\*\*: The disclosure doesn’t address DNC registries, but your policy’s commitment to respecting federal, state, and internal DNC registries (Section 3\) and internal DNC list syncing (every 31 days) ensures compliance, even with the Chen v. All Star Auto ruling’s uncertainty (July 2025).  
  \- \*\*URL Length\*\*: The full URL (\`newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy\`, 27 characters) is long for character-limited displays. A shortened URL (e.g., via bit.ly) or hyperlinked text (“privacy policy”) reduces visual clutter.

\*\*Refined Checkbox Disclosure\*\*:  
\> “☑ I consent to SMS/calls from NDHB & partners. Msg/data rates apply. Reply STOP to opt out. Privacy Policy: newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy”

\*\*Changes\*\*:  
\- Corrected “consnet” to “consent” for clarity and professionalism.  
\- Added a space after “NDHB” for readability (“NDHB & partners”).  
\- Kept “Privacy policy” hyperlinked to \`newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy\`, as you specified.  
\- Maintained 18 words, 109 characters (with spaces and URL), still mobile-friendly.

\*\*Why This Works\*\*:  
\- \*\*Usability\*\*: Fits your three-field form (name, phone, address) on mobile/desktop, addressing your concern about length. Hyperlinked “Privacy policy” minimizes visual space.  
\- \*\*TCPA Compliance\*\*: Covers consent, SMS/calls, partners, message/data rates, opt-out, and policy link, meeting TCPA requirements for express written consent.  
\- \*\*A2P 10DLC Compliance\*\*: Includes brand, opt-in clarity, message/data rates, and opt-out, aligning with CTIA and carrier expectations. Your policy’s details (frequency, DNC) back this up.  
\- \*\*Stakeholder Coverage\*\*: Applies to property owners, cash buyers, and referral partners under your single campaign (per July 29, 2025), with “partners” ensuring third-party consent (per policy Section 5).

\*\*Form Example\*\*:  
\`\`\`html  
\<form action="/submit" method="post"\>  
  \<label\>Name: \<input type="text" name="name" required\>\</label\>\<br\>  
  \<label\>Phone: \<input type="tel" name="phone" required\>\</label\>\<br\>  
  \<label\>Address: \<input type="text" name="address" required\>\</label\>\<br\>  
  \<label\>\<input type="checkbox" name="consent"\> I consent to SMS/calls from NDHB & partners. Msg/data rates apply. Reply STOP to opt out. \<a href="https://newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy"\>Privacy policy\</a\>.\</label\>\<br\>  
  \<button type="submit"\>Submit\</button\>  
\</form\>  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# 2\. Evaluation of Proposed Double Opt-In Text

\*\*Proposed Double Opt-In Text\*\*:  
\> “New Day Homebuyer NDHB needs your reply for msgs/calls per your form. Reply YES or STOP to opt-out. Msg\&data rates apply. newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy”

\*\*Analysis\*\*:  
\- \*\*Length\*\*: 141 characters (including spaces and URL), under the 160-character SMS limit, which is ideal for standard SMS delivery without truncation.  
\- \*\*Usability\*\*: Clear and concise, suitable for users who submit your form without checking the consent box, aligning with your strategy (July 29, 2025\) to validate numbers and gain consent.  
\- \*\*Compliance\*\*:  
  \- \*\*TCPA\*\*:  
    \- \*\*Consent Request\*\*: “Reply YES” requests affirmative action, meeting TCPA’s express written consent requirement for autodialed SMS/calls upon reply.  
    \- \*\*Non-Marketing\*\*: The text avoids promotional content (e.g., no “Sell your home fast\!”), ensuring it’s compliant to send without prior consent.  
    \- \*\*Communication Types\*\*: “Msgs/calls” specifies SMS and calls, covering your channels.  
    \- \*\*Message/Data Rates\*\*: “Msg\&data rates apply” meets TCPA transparency rules.  
    \- \*\*Opt-Out\*\*: “Reply STOP to opt-out” provides an immediate opt-out, complying with TCPA (47 CFR § 64.1200(a)(4)(iii)).  
    \- \*\*Privacy Policy\*\*: The URL links to your policy, supporting informed consent.  
  \- \*\*A2P 10DLC\*\*:  
    \- \*\*Brand\*\*: “New Day Homebuyer NDHB” identifies your brand, meeting CTIA requirements.  
    \- \*\*Opt-In/Opt-Out\*\*: “Reply YES” and “Reply STOP” align with carrier expectations for double opt-in processes.  
    \- \*\*Policy Link\*\*: References your policy, which details A2P 10DLC compliance (Section 3).  
\- \*\*Concerns\*\*:  
  \- \*\*Partners Not Mentioned\*\*: Unlike the checkbox disclosure, it omits “partners,” potentially limiting consent for referral partner communications. Your policy (Section 3\) includes partners, but carriers prefer consistency across opt-in points.  
  \- \*\*Clarity\*\*: “Needs your reply for msgs/calls per your form” is slightly vague. Specifying “SMS/calls about real estate opportunities” clarifies the purpose, as in your prior double opt-in (July 29, 2025).  
  \- \*\*URL Length\*\*: The full URL (\`newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy\`, 27 characters) consumes space. A shortened URL (e.g., bit.ly link) saves characters and improves readability.  
  \- \*\*Redundant “NDHB”\*\*: “New Day Homebuyer NDHB” repeats the brand, using extra characters. Dropping “NDHB” saves space without losing clarity.

\*\*Refined Double Opt-In Text\*\*:  
\> “New Day Homebuyer: Reply YES for SMS/calls from NDHB & partners about real estate. Msg/data rates apply. Reply STOP to opt out. bit.ly/NDHBprivacy”

\*\*Changes\*\*:  
\- \*\*Length\*\*: 134 characters, under 160, ensuring SMS compatibility.  
\- \*\*Brand\*\*: Simplified to “New Day Homebuyer,” removing redundant “NDHB.”  
\- \*\*Clarity\*\*: Changed “needs your reply for msgs/calls per your form” to “Reply YES for SMS/calls from NDHB & partners about real estate” to specify purpose and include partners, aligning with the checkbox disclosure and policy.  
\- \*\*Partners\*\*: Added “& partners” to cover referral partner communications, matching your business model (July 29, 2025).  
\- \*\*URL\*\*: Replaced \`newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy\` with a placeholder \`bit.ly/NDHBprivacy\` (15 characters) to save space. You’ll need to create a shortened URL linking to your policy.  
\- \*\*Punctuation\*\*: Adjusted “Msg\&data” to “Msg/data” for consistency with checkbox disclosure.

\*\*Why This Works\*\*:  
\- \*\*Compliance\*\*: Meets TCPA (non-marketing, consent request, message/data rates, opt-out, policy link) and A2P 10DLC (brand, opt-in/opt-out, policy reference) requirements.  
\- \*\*Usability\*\*: 134 characters ensure delivery as a single SMS, clear for users to read and respond.  
\- \*\*Validation\*\*: Confirms the phone number is active when users reply “YES” or “STOP,” aligning with your goal (July 29, 2025).  
\- \*\*Stakeholders\*\*: Covers property owners, cash buyers, and referral partners under your single campaign, with “partners” ensuring third-party consent (per policy Section 5).

\#\#\# Additional Considerations

\*\*Mobile Usability\*\*:  
\- The checkbox disclosure (18 words, \~109 characters) fits beside the phone field on mobile forms (e.g., \~300px at 14pt font). Test on Carrot’s mobile template to ensure no wrapping.  
\- The double opt-in text (134 characters) is concise for SMS, readable on all devices.

\*\*DNC Compliance\*\*:  
\- Your policy’s DNC commitment (Section 3, “We respect federal, state, and internal Do Not Call registries”) and internal DNC list (synced every 31 days) are sufficient. Scrub numbers against the National DNC Registry (e.g., via SkipTracing.AI, per June 8, 2025\) for unchecked submissions or cold lists, as carriers enforce this despite the Chen ruling (July 2025\) uncertainty.  
\- Log “STOP” replies from the double opt-in text to your DNC list.

\*\*Referral Partners and Stakeholders\*\*:  
\- Both the checkbox disclosure and double opt-in text include “partners,” aligning with your single campaign for all stakeholders (July 29, 2025). Your policy’s requirement for partners to obtain separate consent (Section 5\) ensures FCC “one-to-one consent” compliance.

\*\*QR Code and Mail\*\*:  
\- Your mail campaigns with QR codes (per July 29, 2025\) driving to the form are unregulated under TCPA. The concise disclosure encourages form submissions, with double opt-in covering unchecked cases.

\*\*A2P 10DLC Registration\*\*:  
\- Submit your policy (July 29, 2025), checkbox disclosure, and double opt-in text to your SMS provider (e.g., Twilio, Lofty) for TCR registration. Describe your campaign as “real estate lead generation for wholesaling, targeting property owners, investors, and referral partners.”  
\- Highlight the dual opt-in process (checkbox \+ text) to show robust consent collection.

\*\*Operational Setup\*\*:  
\- \*\*Form Update\*\*: Implement the checkbox disclosure on all forms, ensuring the checkbox is unchecked (per July 29, 2025\) to avoid TCPA/A2P 10DLC violations.  
\- \*\*Double Opt-In\*\*: Configure your SMS platform to send the refined text to unchecked submissions, logging “YES” replies as consent and “STOP”/non-responses as DNC in your CRM (e.g., Lofty, per June 8, 2025).  
\- \*\*URL Shortener\*\*: Create a bit.ly link (e.g., \`bit.ly/NDHBprivacy\`) redirecting to \`newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy\` for the double opt-in text.  
\- \*\*Testing\*\*: Test the form and double opt-in with a small group (e.g., 100 numbers) to ensure deliverability and compliance before scaling.

\#\#\# Final Recommendations  
1\. \*\*Use the Refined Checkbox Disclosure\*\*:  
   \> “☑ I consent to SMS/calls from NDHB & partners. Msg/data rates apply. Reply STOP to opt out. Privacy policy: newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy”  
   \- Add to all forms, hyperlinking “Privacy policy” to \`newdayhomebuyer.com/privacy\`. Keep the checkbox unchecked.

2\. \*\*Use the Refined Double Opt-In Text\*\*:  
   \> “New Day Homebuyer: Reply YES for SMS/calls from NDHB & partners about real estate. Msg/data rates apply. Reply STOP to opt out. bit.ly/NDHBprivacy”  
   \- Send to users who submit without checking the box. Create a shortened URL (e.g., via bit.ly) for the policy. Log responses in your CRM.

3\. \*\*Implementation\*\*:  
   \- Update Carrot-hosted forms with the disclosure and optional checkbox. Test on mobile/desktop.  
   \- Configure your SMS platform to send double opt-in texts and process “YES”/“STOP” replies, syncing DNC lists.  
   \- Log all consent (checkbox and “YES” replies) with timestamps for TCR audits and TCPA defense.

4\. \*\*Start Confidently\*\*:  
   \- Your setup (policy, disclosure, double opt-in) is compliant with TCPA and A2P 10DLC. Test with a small campaign to refine processes, then scale.

\*\*Is It OK?\*\*: Yes, both the checkbox disclosure (with typo corrected) and double opt-in text are compliant and usable, addressing your usability concerns while meeting TCPA/A2P 10DLC standards. The refinements ensure clarity, include partners, and optimize character count.

If you need a specific form code snippet, SMS platform script, or TCR campaign brief, let me know, and I’ll provide them promptly\!

We, therefore, have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

Third-Party Services  
In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.

However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies with respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.

For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.

In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.

As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.

Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.

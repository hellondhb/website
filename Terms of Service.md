## **11\) Changes to Services or Terms**

We may update or modify these Terms at any time. The “Last updated” date reflects the current version. Continued use of the site after changes constitutes acceptance.

**12\) Dispute Resolution — Mandatory, Binding Arbitration; Class Action Waiver; Jury Trial Waiver**

 *Summary (for convenience only): Disputes are resolved through **mandatory, binding arbitration** administered by **AAA** (typically via **remote** hearing). You have a **30-day opt-out right**. The summary is not a substitute for the full terms below; if there’s any conflict, the detailed terms control.*

**(a) FAA and Governing Law.** This Section 12 is governed by the **Federal Arbitration Act (FAA)** and, to the extent state law applies, the laws of the **State of Wyoming**, without regard to conflict-of-law rules.

**(b) Mandatory, Binding Arbitration.** Except for the matters in 12(e) and 12(f) below, **any dispute, claim, or controversy** arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of our sites/services will be resolved by **mandatory, binding arbitration** administered by the **American Arbitration Association (AAA)** under its **Consumer Arbitration Rules** then in effect (the “AAA Rules”). The **arbitrator’s decision is final and binding** with **very limited appeal rights** under the FAA. The arbitrator—not any court—has exclusive authority to resolve disputes about the **scope, enforceability, or formation** of this arbitration agreement (including any claim that all or part of this agreement is void or voidable).

**(c) Venue & Format (Remote-First).** Arbitration **may be conducted by telephone/video, based on written submissions, or in person**. By default, hearings will be **remote (virtual)**. If an in-person hearing is required, it will occur **in the county of your residence** (if in the U.S.) or another location mutually agreed by the parties. The **seat** of arbitration is **Wyoming**.

**(d) Costs.** AAA filing and arbitrator fees will be allocated as required by the **AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules**. Where those Rules require us to pay a greater share, we will do so. Each side otherwise pays its own attorneys’ fees and costs unless the arbitrator awards fees under applicable law.

**(e) Small-Claims Court.** Either party may bring an individual action in **small-claims court** in the county of the consumer’s residence (or another court with jurisdiction) **instead of** arbitration.

**(f) Injunctive Relief (Narrow Carve-Out).** Either party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in court to protect intellectual property or prevent unauthorized access/abuse of the site while arbitration is pending.

**(g) Class/Representative Actions Waiver.** **Disputes must be brought on an individual basis** and **may not** be pursued as class actions, private attorney general actions, or other representative proceedings. **The arbitrator may not consolidate claims** of more than one person.

**(h) Jury Trial Waiver.** If, for any reason, a dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, **you and NDHB waive any right to a jury trial**.

**(i) Opt-Out.** You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by emailing **optout@newdayhomebuyer.com** within **30 days** of first accepting these Terms, with the subject line “Arbitration Opt-Out” and your full name and phone number. Opting out will not affect other provisions of these Terms.
